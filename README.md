# FBD – Freehand Boomer Downloader

![ic_launcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ef1fcd2-0191-4cba-a43c-adeac77cde28)

FBD is an *Android WebView application* designed to **automate** a very specific workflow:  
load a target webpage, trigger a download action automatically, notify the user, and exit cleanly.

This app is built for **speed, automation, and minimal user interaction**, not for casual browsing.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most WebView apps are bloated wrappers.  
FBD is different: it exists to **do one job efficiently**.

**Workflow:**
1. Open a predefined webpage
2. Detect a specific page (`download.php`)
3. Automatically click the download trigger (`id="hdlink"`)
4. Wait for the system download to start
5. Show a confirmation toast
6. Close the app immediately

No extra taps. No confusion.

## 🔐 Permissions

The application asks for only one permission:

```xml  

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

```

## 🧠 Core Logic
### Page Detection

The app checks the loaded URL and triggers logic only when the target page is reached.

### JavaScript Injection

Used to automatically click the download button:

```javascript  

document.getElementById("hdlink")?.click();

```

### Download Handling

Once the system confirms the download has started:

- A toast is shown: “Download started”

- The application exits immediately

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can easily modify:

- Target URL

- Page match condition

- Button ID to trigger

- Auto-exit behavior

- Header UI elements

## ⚠️ Limitations

- DOM-dependent (site structure changes can break automation)

- Not intended for dynamic JS-heavy sites

- Requires the target site to allow WebView interaction

- This is a precision tool, not a universal downloader.

## 📦 Use Cases

- Automated file triggering

- Controlled download flows

- Single-purpose web automation

- Lightweight wrapper for repetitive tasks

- Can be used as a template for other such websites

## 📄 License

Open for educational and personal use.
